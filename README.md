# ResourceManager
A simple(ish) resource manager for a game engine I'm making.
I'm working on this first to stop myself from jumping straight into vulkan rendering;
because the past few time I did, I just out right gave up because it got to hard.
I'm writing this here as a reminder and encouragement for myself.
